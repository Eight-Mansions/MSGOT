# Mobile Suit Gundam: Operation: Troy English Translation v1.0 (November 2022) #

# Patch Notes #
The game is fully translated.
*  Menu Briefings Translated
*  Menu Opening and Endings Translated
*  Help Text Translated
*  Multiplayer Text Translated
*  Mobile Suit Garage/Customizations Text Translated
*  All Images Edited and Translated

The game runs as expected on original Xbox 360 hardware, however, you will require a way to play modified game content.

# Installation #
Only the translated xdelta patch files are included; you will need an existing copy of Mobile Suit Gundam: Operation: Troy.
You will also need an Xdelta patch utility. Preferably a batch version, as you will need to patch many files.

1. Extract downloaded xdelta patch files to any location

2. Use XDELTA to patch the files located at [ Contents -> textures -> XUI ]
